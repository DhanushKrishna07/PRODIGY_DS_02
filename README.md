This is task 2 of Prodigy InfoTech | Data Science Domain.

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

 ðŸš¢ Predicting Titanic Survival Using Machine Learning ðŸŒŠ
 
I am excited to share my latest project where I utilized the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a RandomForestClassifier. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in making data-driven predictions and offers insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

Project Highlights:

â€¢Analyzed the survival rates of passengers based on gender.
â€¢Applied a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival outcomes.
â€¢Generated a submission file for Kaggle's Titanic competition.

Steps Involved:

â€¢Imported essential libraries for data manipulation and machine learning, including numpy, pandas, and sklearn.
â€¢Explored the dataset structure by printing file paths and reading the train and test datasets using pandas.
â€¢Calculated survival rates based on gender to gain initial insights:
â€¢Prepared the data for machine learning by selecting relevant features and converting categorical variables into numerical ones using pd.get_dummies.
â€¢Trained a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators and a maximum depth of 5 to predict survival on the test dataset.
â€¢Generated predictions and created an output file (my_submission.csv) for submission to the Kaggle competition.

Key Takeaway:

â€¢Identified that the survival rate of women was higher than that of men.
â€¢Using data science and machine learning techniques, we can effectively predict survival outcomes in historical datasets like the Titanic. This project demonstrates the power of data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of ensemble learning methods.
